## Description ##

Next-generation Recent Posts widget which fetches posts via the WP REST API, renders then into the widget via JavaScript templates, and provides a JS-driven Customizer control. It will continue fetching the any next new posts every minute.

Note: To truly be a next-generation Recent Posts widget, it use [JS Widgets](https://github.com/xwp/wp-js-widgets) as its foundation.

This plugin was developed to showcase the [Customize REST Resources](https://github.com/xwp/wp-customize-rest-resources) plugin.
